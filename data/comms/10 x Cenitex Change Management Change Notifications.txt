Change Notification
 
 
Implementation of 60 day archives on selected shared mailboxes
Service affected:	Microsoft Outlook
Customer/s affected:	CSV
Scheduled start:	11 am                Tuesday 9 July 2019  (AEST)
Scheduled end:	12 pm (noon)    Tuesday 9 July 2019  (AEST)
Outage window:	No outage
Site/s:	All
Impact to service:	Nil
Impact to end user:	Some shared mailboxes will have data older than 60 days archived to the online archive.
As data is archived out of the shared mailboxes, the removal needs to be synced to the customers’ local machines. If the mailbox user is in the mailbox when this happens, they may experience a brief ‘locking’ of Outlook while the local copy of the shared mailbox is updated.
Application validation:	This is the same as the current archiving service, only with a shorter archive period.  It is coming down from 365 days
Customer testers:	Nil
Change restriction:	Refer to the restrictions insITe page.

Customer briefing:	Nil
Change reference number:	CRQ000000188742
Additional information:	CSV users are having issues whereby the local copies of certain shared mailboxes are taking up too much room on their local machines. This issue is particularly problematic for:
•	users of very large shared mailboxes
•	users of multiple shared mailboxes
•	users who ‘hot desk’
•	laptop users.
 
We have seen that reducing the archive period of shared mailboxes to 60 days, as was the case in Lotus Notes, eliminates this issue for users.
 
The archive change will occur on Tuesday 9 July and processing will occur over the following 24 hours.
 
A list of the affected mailboxes is attached to this email.
