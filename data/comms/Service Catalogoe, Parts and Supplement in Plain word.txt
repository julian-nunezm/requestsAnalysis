Understand planned vs. unplanned maintenance (Azure)
There are two types of Microsoft Azure platform events that can affect the availability
of your virtual machines: planned maintenance and unplanned maintenance.
Planned maintenance events are periodic updates made by Microsoft to the underlying
Azure platform to improve overall reliability, performance, and security of the platform
infrastructure that your virtual machines run on. Most these updates are performed
without any impact upon your virtual machines or cloud services. However, there are
instances where these updates require a reboot of your virtual machine to apply the
required updates to the platform infrastructure.
Unplanned maintenance events occur when the hardware or physical infrastructure
underlying your virtual machine has faulted in some way. This may include local
network failures, local disk failures, or other rack level failures. When such a failure is
detected, the Azure platform will automatically migrate your virtual machine from
the unhealthy physical machine hosting your virtual machine to a healthy physical
machine. Such events are rare, but may also cause your virtual machine to reboot.
Billing
Customers are billed quarterly based on consumption and Cenitex service
management. The billing will contain three price categories Azure Pass Through
(Variable), Cenitex Support, other Cenitex on premise services e.g. Backup.
Service Levels
Microsoft makes certain service level commitments to you under the Service Level
Agreement that forms part of your Microsoft Customer Agreement. You can find the
applicable service levels for Microsoft Azure services at http://azure.microsoft.com/
support/legal/sla/. Cenitex provides its support backed by the Microsoft SLA’s
Note: single instance virtual machine do not have a SLA with Microsoft. Only virtual
machines in an availability set will be have a 99.95% availability SLA.
Privacy and Data
Microsoft has made a commitment to provide reasonable assistance to support
Cenitex and its customers comply with, the Privacy and Data Protection Act 2014 in
regard to personal information. Microsoft has agreed not to do an act or engage in
a practice that contravenes the Victorian Protective Data Security Standards in the
provision of Online Services to Cenitex and its customers
Term
Unless you or we cancel your Microsoft Azure subscription, your subscription will
automatically renew monthly.
Termination
No early termination charges will apply in relation to a Microsoft Azure service.
Customer are required to provide Cenitex 30 days’ notice in written when the would like
a service terminated. Customers will be charged by Microsoft until the service is fully
de-provisioned.

Additional information:
These Security Services are included as part of the Standard Desktop and Hosting
Services
Application Whitelisting only allows approved software to run on your PC or notebook.
All other software will be prevented from running regardless of its purpose or the
location from where it is run.
If you attempt to install software that is not registered in Whitelisting, you will receive
an error message advising to call the Service Desk. The Service Desk will check to see
if the application has been previously packaged for remote installation to your PC or
notebook and if it has, it will be installed at no charge.
If the software you attempted to install has not been previously packaged, you will
need to either:
• Log a request for a Manual Software Installation; or
• Log a request to have your software Packaged Software for Deployment.
As part of your request, Cenitex will check to see if the Software is safe to be run within
the corporate environment (check that it cannot be used by hackers to gain control of
your data) and if it is, it will be added to the approved list of software and your request
will be completed.
If it is found that your software is not safe to be run within the corporate environment
the Service Desk will contact you, advising that they are unable to proceed with
your request as the software you have requested has been classified as potentially
“malicious” and no further action will be taken.
If the Software is imperative to your business function you can log a request to
convert your Standard Desktop to an Local Administration Access which will provide
you with local system administration rights allowing you to install the Software.
Your departmental CIO or Agency IT Manager will assess your request as they must
acknowledge and accept the risk associated with the Local Administration Access.
Please refer to Local Administration Access within the catalogue to understand
conditions.

• Workplace Support Services (WSS) team member on your site:
At the request of a Departmental CIO to the CE Account Manager (AM), one WSS
team member may be deployed to an on-site customer location on a monthly
rotational basis.
The customer’s request will be approved based on the following criteria:
– They are a Department
– They are an agency and average 160 incidents for the nominated site per month
– The Director of Customer Engagement agrees to the deployment
– The customer agrees to and can support the necessary work conditions
– The requesting customer will provide a permanent desk with desk phone and desk
chair at their own cost for the team member.
– The team member involved and the location at which they will be based will be
negotiated by the CE AM and responsible SO General Manager (GM) or their
nominated delegate.
– Unless the customer has two or more site buildings that are adjacent, there will
be no expectation for the team member to provide support at any other building
occupied by the customer.
– The deployed team member will continue to function as a member of the WSS
team and will remain subject to Cenitex work practices, entitlements, and existing
WSS processes and procedures that exist at that time. It is expected that the team
member will spend up to one half of one day per week (on average) attending
training/information sessions, or team meetings.
– Should an operational situation arise that warrants the team members temporary
return to Cenitex, the Service Manager of Workplace Technology Services may
approve their return ensuring that the CE AM and SO GM are informed of the
action, the reason and anticipated period of their return.
– At no time, will a member of the team that is deployed to a customer site be
backfilled on-site. During times of absence, the customer will continue to be served
by the centrally located team.

SS2.5 Desktop Support – VIP
Additional information:
• Priority Response to Incidents
• Priority support for incidents and requests is provided only for the Premium User’s
Desktop. Support and/or multi requests for other users will be managed as per the
appropriate non-Premium Desktop support target.
• Faults that impede the delivery of services to the Desktop (see “Details about what
you get”) of a Premium customer will be treated as a Premium call. If a fault exists
with an underlying desktop service (e.g. Network) then that fault cannot be treated
as a Premium request. Incidents reported for faults that require data restores cannot
be treated as Premium as the data restoration mechanism has not been designed to
meet these stringent service levels.
• Premium users need to log requests/faults via a call to the Service Centre as opposed
to email/fax to get the best benefit out of this service.
• A dedicated Premium Service Menu option has been created for users when dialling
the 1800 020 140 number.
• Faults reported against Local Administration Access machines will not be treated as
a Premium call.
After department approval, how many business days will it take to get the service?

Additional information:
See (SS2) Desktop Support – Standard Desktop for standard WSS support inclusions,
plus:
• Premium service and Cenitex SLAs do not apply to any customer allocated task.
• Workplace Support On-Site team member on your site:
– At the request of a Departmental CIO to the CE Account Manager (AM), Cenitex will
provision an On-Site team member who will be deployed to your on-site customer
site or campus.
– The requesting customer will provide a permanent desk with desk phone and desk
chair at their own cost for the team member.
– The location at which On-Site team member will be based will be negotiated by the
CE AM and responsible SO General Manager (GM) or their nominated delegate.
– The On-Site support team member will be free to move to other customer office
locations to perform support work, but this movement must be an exceptional
circumstance and any transport or accommodation costs must be met by the
customer.
– The deployed team member will continue to function as a member of the WSS
team and will remain subject to Cenitex work practices, entitlements, and existing
WSS processes and procedures that exist at that time. It is expected that the team
member will spend up to one half of one day per week (on average) attending
training/information sessions, or team meetings.
– The On-Site team member will be available to perform IT related work as may be
deemed necessary by the customer. The types of tasks that will be assigned to the
On-Site team member must be discussed with the WSS Team lead to ensure that
workload expectations are understood. Any training or tool costs associated with
the task will be met by the customer.
– When constrained, customer related IT work will take precedence over Cenitex
support work. In these circumstances the Cenitex support work can be performed
by the Central WSS team.
– Other than for the period of up to half a day a week, the On-Site support team
member cannot be requested to return to Cenitex during urgent operational
situations.
– At no time, will an On-Site team member that is deployed to a customer site be
backfilled on-site. During times of absence, the customer will continue to be served
by the centrally located team.
How many business days will it take to get the service?

Rate Card
The rate card for in-house resourced projects has been reviewed to reflect the true
cost of providing services to our customers. The category for externally sourced project
resources specify the Contractor rates, which will be maintained, to provide subject
matter expertise in a timely manner where there is insufficient demand for Cenitex
to provide ongoing employment. Preference in using Cenitex resources will result in
reduced lead time for creating project teams and give the customer access to the
technical expertise of the internal PMO team.
The external rate is the indicative resource cost incurred by Cenitex and includes the
cost to procure services. Resources sourced via e-Services panel will be priced on
application.
Rates apply to all Time and Material and fixed price project work. Prices are
excluding GST.

Terms Comment
The Chrome and Firefox
browsers will be out of the box
and will not be customised in
any way.
The current SOE browser is IE and it has been
extensively tailored for the department, such as
default home pages and interoperability with TRIM
etc.
The Chrome and Firefox
browsers will be updated with
each SWMR.
The browsers would be updated via the SWMR
process three times per year. Any additional changes
to this update cycle will need to be addressed through
the standard (tier-4) software packaging service.
The Chrome and Firefox
browsers will be deployed to all
departmental PCs as per the
terms of tier-4 software under
the SOE.
The product will be rolled-out to all departmental
devices.
The Chrome and Firefox
browsers will remain
unsupported products,
although any issue that may
be caused by a broader issue
with Cenitex services will be
investigated and resolved.
Any websites or applications that do not work
properly within the Chrome or Firefox browsers will be
checked against the existing SOE default browser. If
they are found to work with the default browser then
no further action will be taken by Cenitex. If the same
issues exist within the default browser, Cenitex will
follow a standard incident resolution procedure to
resolve the issues within the default browser only.
Customer will fund work
to remove all versions of
Chrome browser that has
been installed previously by
individuals in the user-context
on the PC.
Required as user-context installed software will
interfere with the packaged installed software.
Chrome & Firefox
The customer has agreed to the following “terms” for the installation of Chrome &
Firefox to the whole department
Terms Comment
Neither browsers will be made
the default for the desktop OS.
The existing default browser for the SOE is IE and
the addition of these two additional browsers will not
change this fact.

Appendix E Hosting Services Definition
Cenitex’s Hosting Services can reduce the complexity of running business systems by
taking care of the provisioning and ongoing management and maintenance of server
hardware, operating system and network infrastructure, thus providing an environment
to host your important websites and applications. Cenitex manages the day-to-day
system maintenance tasks like patching.
Hosting models
Cenitex provides a range of Hosting Combinations tailored to meet a wide array of
customer needs.
Mode Management Model Description
Shared Fully Managed Your application, web-site or database instance can be hosted on one of the Cenitex supported platform servers in a shared environment
where many other instances co-reside. Each instance “sits” in its own section of the platform keeping it separate from other instances.
This is generally the most economical option for hosting, as many share the overall cost of the platform.
Dedicated Fully Managed Cenitex recognises there are times when you have a specific business, security or performance requirement that warrants your
applications or databases to be hosted on their own server.
Cenitex can provide a fully managed, dedicated server platform for this purpose.
Dedicated Co-Managed The Dedicated Co-Managed option provides you, or your nominated 3rd party vendor, with the level of access to the systems that enables
you to perform your necessary application management functions.
Because of your increased level of access to systems and ability to make changes to the environment, Cenitex cannot offer the same
Service Level as for Fully Managed.
Cenitex will patch the Operating System. Cenitex will provide support for the O/S in line with the level of access granted to you. Cenitex
will provide backup and restore services, but these will be limited to being at a file system level. You will be responsible for ensuring the
backup data is in an agreed location and is suitable for backup and restoration purposes.
This offering is specifically tailored to allow you and/or your nominated vendor the necessary level of access to the system to support the
application.

Appendix J Service Level Relief Events
Cenitex will be accountable for all products and services which it manages and has
control of. There will be circumstances where events may cause the need for service
level relief. Notwithstanding, Cenitex will still actively assist the customer to aid in
resolving service issues where possible.
The following will be regarded as Service Level Relief Events and will be excluded from
performance reporting:
Category Service Level Relief Event

Scheduled hardware maintenance downtime as agreed by all relevant parties.

Software Failure of application due to a vendor-specific software fault (as determined by the Cenitex Incident Manager).
Incidents which are attributed to software that has not been socialised.

Provided that Cenitex has complied with all obligations in relation to documented security policies and virus protection.
Other Downtime which is not deemed to be caused by some failure on the part of Cenitex.
Restoration of Service levels will not apply to Open Workplace devices or to Co-Managed Hosting platforms (as Cenitex does not have sole administrative control of the
device).
Power failures such as electrical outages or failure of the electrical infrastructure at a Department’s site, not caused by Cenitex.

Service levels will not apply to calls which require resolution from service providers whose contracts Cenitex does not manage.
Any event or circumstance which is classified as being an “Act of God” or force majeure (e.g. flooding, earthquake, or riot).
In State-wide emergency support circumstances, service levels will be negotiated with the customer. Cenitex will provide best efforts towards consistent delivery of
services; however, support for state-wide emergency situations will take priority.
Microsoft Service restoration are reliant on the availability of the Microsoft Azure Platform. Cenitex will provide all reasonable efforts restoration as we provision our
service based on the up time of the Microsoft Azure Platform. There are no service restoration targets for the Azure Compute service.
